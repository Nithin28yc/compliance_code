For a more detailed list of the purposes, please see section 4.
Accenture will not use your personal data for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes listed in this global privacy statement, unless it is required or authorized by law, or it is in your own vital interest (e.g. in case of a medical emergency) to do so.
On which legal basis does Accenture process your personal data?
